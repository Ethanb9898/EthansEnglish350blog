# Project overview
When I began my grant “nationalism by numbers”, I never knew there were so many factors that were still unknown.  In the beginning, my project was aiming to determine whether the increasing number of people joining nationalist groups online influenced real life attacks and protests.  However, a big problem was the fact that there is no data on the increase of people in these groups.  We know that they have had increasing numbers in the past years, however, there is no peer reviewed data on the specific numbers.  Therefor during the process, I changed from the amount of people in these groups, to the number of bans on online platforms. I obtained the number of bans on online platforms through Facebook reports that give data on how many people were reported, how many people were banned, and why those people were banned.  Because of these releases I got my hands on actual quantifiable data instead of surveys asking what people thought.
## Environmental Scan
Looking back on my grant, the hardest part was the environmental scan.  Not only had I never done one before, but the topic I was covering didn’t have much other quantitative research done on it.  It is difficult to try and calculate the amount of hate speech online and how much it’s been growing.  I did come across other projects that help me understand what my design could look like and gave an example of what mine could look like finished.  I took special note of Jigsaw’s “[Hate by the Numbers](https://jigsaw.google.com/the-current/white-supremacy/data-visualization/)” as their data visualization really helped me envision my own.

## Budget
I had no real troubles with my budget.  Most of it would go towards monthly payments on a website and the data visualization software tableau.  The other bit would only really be needed to buy access to the big data set found in the global terrorism database.  I would probably only need tableau for a month or so however the website would have to be paid monthly to keep the project online.  It was interesting doing research into what goes into these kinds of budgets.  Usually, a portion would go to graphic designer or something similar, however I believe I am capable of doing most of the work myself as long as the website portion is hosted on a beginner friendly service.

## Resume
The final section in my grant was my resume.  I found it interesting how I had to separate the resume I usually use for jobs and the resume I use for this grant writing.  In the grant writing resume, I had to make sure to focus on the necessary skills for my grant.  Things like my experience in tableau and python were more important than things like how well I work with a team.  It is kind of opposite of a resume for a job in that respective.

## Class Overview
This class gave me a much better understanding of digital humanities over the past 15 weeks.  Coming into this, I had no real clue on what digital humanities included.  I thought maybe it had something to do with social media and blogs.  However now I know it includes anything that uses the advantages of being hosted online and applies that to the humanities.  It’s a relatively new and evolving field that covers a large area of topics.  This class showed me not only what makes a digital humanities project different but also the array of advantages the platform provides. 
This class also introduced me to TEI web code.  I thought out of everything this semester, this was the thing that could most benefit me in the future.  Although all we had was an introduction, I enjoyed my time learning about the very basics of TEI.  Although mine was a bit messy, I’m also glad I got to contribute to an actual digital humanities project.  I'm looking forward to putting what I've learned in this class to use in my future.
