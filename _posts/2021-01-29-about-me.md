# Who am I?
To start, I am a business management major here at CNU.  My goal is to become a data analyst out of college.  A bit strange but I've found I actually enjoy working and manipulating data.  The reason I became interested in digital humanities and website design is actually to compliment my skills in programming software like R and Python.  It'll look good on a resume and I think it will help me in my future careers.
