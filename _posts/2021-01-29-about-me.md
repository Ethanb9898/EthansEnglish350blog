# Who am I?
To start, I am a business management major here at CNU.  My goal is to become a data analyst out of college.  A bit strange but I've found I actually enjoy working with and manipulating data.  The reason I became interested in digital humanities and website design is actually to compliment my skills in programming software like R and Python.  It'll look good on a resume and I think it will help me in my future careers.  

## other things I'm into

well to start i've been playing a mix of tabletop roleplaying games for the past 5 years every week with the same group.  So i'm kind of addicted.  Dungeons and dragons is the go to but I've played things like warhammer dark heresy and champions.  If i'm not hanging around friends playing tabletop games or drinking, you can probably find me reading and listening to music.  I'm pretty huge into almost every music scene and try and keep up with every release.  My favorite genre is always chaning but my favorite artist is Anderson Paac.  I also have recently gotten into Daniel Johnson and his strange basement music.  In fact his album _hi how are you?_ is my background on [twitter](https://twitter.com/EthanEnglish16).

### Fun facts about me!
* I'm missing one of my bottom teeth.
* I went to states for tennis in college.
* Favorite animals are rabbits and I still have my childhood stuffed bunny named... bunny.
* My friends are all yelling at me as I write this!
