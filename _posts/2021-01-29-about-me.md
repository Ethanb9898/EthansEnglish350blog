# Who am I?
To start, I am a business management major here at CNU.  My goal is to become a data analyst out of college.  A bit strange but I've found I actually enjoy working with and manipulating data.  The reason I became interested in digital humanities and website design is actually to compliment my skills in programming software like R and Python.  It'll look good on a resume and I think it will help me in my future careers.  

## other things I'm into

well to start i've been playing a mix of tabletop roleplaying games for the past 5 years every week with the same group.  So i'm kind of addicted.  Dungeons and dragons is the go to but I've played things like warhammer dark heresy and champions.  Other than that I spend a lot of my free time reading and just hanging around friends.
