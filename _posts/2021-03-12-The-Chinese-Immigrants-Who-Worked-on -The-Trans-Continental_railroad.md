## Chinese Railroad Workers In North America

“Chinese Railroad Workers in North America” is a digital humanities project by Stanford university tracking the Chinese work force that built a majority of the transcontinental railroad between the years of 1865 and 1869.  This was the largest engineering project in American history and this project is a digital visualization of the area the Chinese immigrants built on the west coast, from California to Utah.  It provides insights into the grueling work the Chinese immigrants did and doesn’t shy away from the racist demeanor most Americans looked at them with.  Providing real statements from the president of the railroad gave to congress like “The presence of numbers of that degraded and distinct people [Chinese] would exercise a deleterious effect upon the superior race.”.

The homepage is easy to look at and lists everything you would need to get started on learning about the Chinese immigrants who worked on the railroad.  With key questions on when, where and how answered being the first tab most people would click.   Then with different publications, information of the team and resources right under that.  This being said, the main portion of this project is hidden.  The digital visualization is only a link in the home page instead of on the side.  This is a shame as it seems to contain most of the information on the actual railroad.  A lot of good work went into it and I think making it easier to access would benefit this project a lot.  
The data visualization portion is segmented by the 15 times where the work force had to blast through a mountain.  Stopping and giving historical insight and research into each segment.   This makes it very easy to follow along.  As you scroll down the page, you follow a set path that the Chinese work Force took.  At the top of the page is a map that allows easy access to different areas.  I like how this map follows you as you scroll, allowing the reader to easily understand the flow of time with each segment.   There is also a button to hide the map in the top right corner, letting the text take up a larger portion of the screen.  
Each segment also contains a modern-day overhead picture of where they worked, with the railroad itself highlighted to make it easy to see.  I love seeing this implemented as it gives a good scope how much ground they covered and how it still stands today.  If I could recommend adding anything, I would like to be able to zoom in and out of certain areas.  I understand this could be asking for a lot, however the pictures themselves are already taken from google earth.  It would be a nice addition and would allow people to fully grasp just how large this railroad was.  This being said, the coordinates for google earth are given with the project so people could plug them into google earth themselves.   All in all, the bird eye’s view adds a lot to the overall project.  
“Chinese Railroad Workers in North America” is a digital humanities project that should not be overlooked.  It sheds a light on how important Chinese immigrants were to the creation of our country and how they were wrongfully treated.  It is a very easy to navigate site with lots of information and resources linked that provide ways people can continue their research in depth.  The visualization is a great tool that is used to great affect in showing the scale and history of the project.  It succeeds in everything it set out for and is a wonderful place for learning and research.
