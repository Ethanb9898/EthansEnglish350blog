# TEI Code

For this assignment, I was tasked to encode 4 pages of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper” in the XML editor oxygen. I have some experience in programming, mostly in R and a bit of Python, however most of my experience is in working and manipulating numeric data so this was very different from what I’m used to.  

The first thing I did was use Microsoft word to comment on the text and annotate where I would need to code certain things into the text.  I had trouble in the second paragraph as it was awkwardly spaced, and I was not sure whether or not the author meant that as separate paragraphs or it was just a way of indicating that a new sentence started.  I decided to just mark each as an extra space in the writing.   If it does turn out to imply separate paragraphs, it is an easy enough change to add some breaks within the long paragraph.
