# TEI Code

For this assignment, I was tasked to encode 4 pages of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper” in the XML editor oxygen. I have some experience in programming, mostly in R and a bit of Python, however most of my experience is in working and manipulating numeric data so this was very different from what I’m used to.
